                <h2>Who Am I</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Muhamed Razik. I'm a 21-year-old intern at Luminar Technolab - Calicut, currently  
                    focusing on mastering the ME(A)RN stack. My goal is to become highly skilled at building efficient and  
                    scalable web applications.</p>  
                 
                 <p>My love for coding started after watching actors do cool things with code in movies. My first thought was,  
                    "Whoa, he looks so coolâ€”I want to be like that!" Even though I had an interest in coding, I truly started  
                    learning at the beginning of my bachelor's degree. From that moment, I knew I wanted to be a developer who  
                    brings cool ideas to life through code. Now, here I am, pushing myself to become a master developer.</p>  
                 
                 <p>What keeps me going is the extreme happiness and excitement I feel every time I solve a problem or get my  
                    code right. I never get bored of that feeling, and it fuels my passion for continuous learning.</p>
                 
                <p>My Preferences include minimalism, Dark Theme and Rounded typography</p>
